have materials loaded instead of textures loaded?

vector<material_t> materials_loaded;

load all textures from materials at beginning and store
textures in loaded_textures array

then we just check if we have loaded the current material face id
and if not we just add all the textures to the meshes vector;

material_t mat = materials[0];

template??

if(!mat.diffuse_texname.empty()){

}
